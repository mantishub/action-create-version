# MantisHub Create Version GitHub Action

This is an action that will often be triggered when a new tag is applied to the repo. For example, when a tag is added, create a version in MantisHub for the release.
### Usage
To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your workflow file:

The defaults for field are:

- `released` defaults to `true`.
- `obsolete` defaults to `false`.
- `timestamp` defaults to `now`.

```yaml
jobs:
  create-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: vboctor/action-create-version
      - name: Run Create Version Action
        id: create-version
        uses: vboctor/action-create-version@v1
        with:
          url: https://example.mantishub.io
          api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          project: 'MyProject'
          name: 'v1.1.13'
          description: |
            Release Version 1.1.13
            For bugs fixes
          released: false
          obsolete: true
          timestamp: '2025-09-20'
```
### Example workflow file
This workflow demonstrates how to use the action-create-version in a GitHub Actions pipeline to update an existing release version and create a new one in a MantisHub project. The workflow checks out the code, runs the custom action, and retrieves the new version ID, showcasing effective version management automation.
#### Using Step ID to Fetch Outputs in GitHub Actions
In GitHub Actions, you can use the id field to assign a unique identifier to a step within a job. This identifier allows you to reference the outputs of that step in subsequent steps within the same job.
For example, in the workflow below, the step Run Create Version Action is assigned the ID create-version. Later, the output version-id generated by this step can be accessed using the syntax `${{ steps.create-version.outputs.version-id }`} in the Get new version id step.

```yaml
name: "MantisHub Example Workflow"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  create-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: vboctor/action-create-version
      - name: Run Create Version Action
        id: create-version
        uses: vboctor/action-create-version@v1
        with:
          url: 'https://example.mantishub.io'
          api-key: {{some-token}}
          project: 'MyProject'
          name: 'v1.1.13'
          description: |
            Release Version 1.1.13
            For bugs fixes
          released: false
          obsolete: true
          timestamp: '2025-09-20'
      - name: Get new version id 
        run: echo  ${{ steps.create-version.outputs.version-id }}
```
